<p>Excerpt From The ET Enigma, 2nd Edition</p>

<p>I reported a black orb to MUFON and it was case 67958 on July 09 2015 Claremont Ca in the early evening about an hour before sunset. They wrote back and said it was probably a bat or a bug.</p>

<p>I found the case numbers interesting because I noticed they could be written as the consecutive integers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So, I looked up case 56789.</p>

<p>It was in Utah at 10:17 PM. Interestingly, I knew that the SETI Wow! Signal was at 10:17 PM Eastern time. It was thought by SETI (Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence) to have all the earmarks of an extraterrestrial signal. Hence its name (The Wow! Signal). It was on August 15, 1977 at 10:17 PM Eastern time. It lasted 72 seconds.</p>

<p>Looking at a map of Utah, a predominantly mormon state, I found at its center was a city called NEPHI. I Knew that Nephilim was Hebrew for those who came from above. According to Zecharia Sitchin, Nephilim was Hebrew for the Sumerian Annunaki, which were said to be those who came from the heavens and gave them science, agriculture, mathematics, and government. The Sumerians were according to archaeologists, the first to settle down from hunting and invent agriculture and civilization.</p> 
<p>I then noticed to the left of Nephi, in Nevada is Area 51, the famed secret military base where many think there are extraterrestrials teaching us to make craft capable of interstellar travel. I noticed to the right was Devil’s Tower, the National Monument where our first contact was made in the movie Close Encounter’s of the Third kind. I then noted directly below Nephi was Roswell New Mexico, where a UFO was thought to have crashed and three bodies of short (3 foot tall aliens) were recovered. This forms a cross for which I calculated the top portion using the golden ratio. This top was in Treasure Valley on the Idaho-Oregon Valley. I noticed the cross pointed to Houston, Texas, NASA mission control.</p>

<p>We place a star at Nephi, a star at Roswell, a star at area 51, a star at treasure valley, and to complete the cross a star at the Arapahoe Indian reservation near the the center of Wyoming which is, a reflection of area 51 about the Nephi-Roswell axis. See the illustration below…</p>

<p> We place a star at Nephi, Roswell, Area 51, Treasure Valley, and right on Devils Tower in Wyoming. We also place a star at Houston, NASA Mission Control… </p>
