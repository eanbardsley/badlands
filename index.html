<p><em> Chance and necessity do not explain the origin of life</p>

<p>(J.T. Trevors, D.L. Abel, 2004)</p>

<p>Peer-reviewed life origin literature presupposes that, given enough time, genetic instructions arose via natural events. Thus far no paper has provided a plausible mechanism for natural-process algorithm-writing.</p>

<p>Following cooling, it is difficult to understand how natural processes could have generated the following aspects of life in such a short time:</p>

<p>(1) a genetic operating system with which to record programming instructions,<p>
<p>(2) The programs themselves for production or assembly of every individual building block, biochemical pathway, and metabolic cycle needed for even the simplest protometabolism to develop, and</p>
<p>(3) A coding system with which to translate triplet codon <q>language</q> into polyamino acid language.</p>

<p>We must not only find models for specific genetic programming, but for the genetic operating system.</em></p>

<p>I suggest rather than beginning with step 1, the prebiotic chemical reactions leading to DNA and Amino Acids, we begin at step 0, if we are to compare life to the origin of natural algorithm  writing machines, by looking at the comparison of biological components in the densities, radii, and molar masses of their atoms and compounds to those of artificial intelligence (AI). I have done just that, here.</p>

<p>Trevors and Abel further write:</p>

</p> <em>Natural selection could select the fittest already programmed phenotypes. Natural selection could not have programmed nucleic acid algorithms at the covalently-bound primary structure (sequence) level.</em></p>

<p>I would like to say here that the components from which AI are made, such as silicon and germanium, or their doping agents like phosphorus and boron and gallium and arsenic, were not made by humans, but produced by Nature. To make logic circuits they required humans to figure out that doping the silicon and germanium with the doping agents would make them semiconduct, and that humans then had to figure out how to organize the semiconductors into a series of switches. Thus we see that similarily perhaps a sentient being programmed nucleic acid algorithms, then Nature used natural selection to modify them.</p>

<p>Thus I see value in comparing the physical characteristics of biological life to those of AI to perhaps learn how biological life got its start.</p>
